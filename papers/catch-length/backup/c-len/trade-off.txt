The trade-offs between bias and precision are shown in Figure 2; DBSRA is the most precise method although negatively biased compared to SSS, while for length based methods LBSPR has a tendancy to be more precise but also more biased than LIME. Bias and precision are both important factors to consider when assessing fish stocks, bias reflects how close an estimate is to an accepted value and precision reflects how reproducible an estimate is. For example if an assessment is to be reconducted every year to monitor the impact of a management measure, a precise but biased method would be able to detect a trend better than an unbiased but imprecise method. As when taking scientific measurements this require calibration, which in the case of fish stock asessment can be performed using MSE. where the choice of parameters and reference points in a managment procedure HCR are calibrated, i.e. tuned to meet the desired management objectives as represented by the Operating Model. Considering precision as well as bias is therefore important particularly as in the simulations results bias is underestimated as the priors and fixed parameter values were based on the OM.
