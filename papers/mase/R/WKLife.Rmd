# Summary

20  |ICES WKLIFE VIII REPORT 2018The simulations regarding the information content and misspecification of the prior on n,  demonstrate  that  the  informative  prior  (here  0.1)  can  help  model  performance  in  terms of reducing the estimation error of relative states and reducing the size of confi-dence intervals compared with the assessment without prior (Figure 2.10). Figure 2.10. Two SPiCT assessments with a theoretical stock with n = 2, where the first column used a no prior on n and the second column used a prior of 0.1.The  gradual  improvement  of  model  performance  (decreasing  error  and  decreasing  confidence intervals) by use of a prior with increasing information content for the stock with n =2 is also obvious in Figure 2.11. However, this pattern does not necessary hold anymore, if the prior is misspecified and tightened: For the n=0.6 stock the confidence intervals do not decrease and for n=3.5 the confidence intervals even increase with de-crease prior. However, for all theoretical stocks the tighter prior helps model conver-gence (n=1.2 & n=3.5 without prior do not converge) and decrease the estimation error in F/FMSY and B/BMSY (Figure 2.22). The estimation error for the relative states decreases although the misspecified tight prior on n determines the estimated value of n (Figure2.23).
ICES WKLIFE VIII REPORT 2018|  23 Based on the results presented here, MSY-PA advice rule, e.g. MSY-PA-95 with a sta-bility clause (±50%) can be recommended as overall well-performing advice rules for SPiCT assessments. This decision was based on following points: (i) The advice rules are  more  conservative  than  the  median  advice  rule  suggested  by  WKMSYCat34;  (ii)  They  take  assessment  uncertainty  into  account  (observation  and  process  noise  of  the  model and uncertainty of estimated reference points); (iii) They show high yield levels and more consistent patterns for high levels of recruitment variability of the operating model than the MSY rules. Different values for PPA ca be considered, which should be adopted on a stock-by-stock basis. Lower values could for example be reasonable due to  socio-economic  reasons  when  a  (close  to)  zero  TAC  is  unacceptable,  or  if  there  is  other evidence not utilized by SPiCT, that indicate a healthy stock status. Higher PPAvalues  could  be  considered  if  some  model  assumption(s)  are  known  to  be  seriously  violated. The use of priors, in particular for hard to estimate parameters (e.g. n; Wang et  al.,   2014; Thorsen et  al.,   2012) should be considered to help model convergence. In the  best  case,  no  priors  are  needed,  however,  if  data  quality  and  quantity  reach  the  limits of SPiCT requirements (scenarios 4, 5 and 6), priors with varying degree of in-formation content can be used and results compared with each other. However, cau-tion is required as a more informative prior affects the width of the confidence intervals and  thus  the  recommended  TAC.  In  order  to  account  for  the  decreased  confidence  bounds, it is recommended to use a more conservative advice rule, such as e.g. MSY-PA-97 with stability clause (±50%) when tight priors on n are used (tighter than sd=2). The  stability  clause  of  ±50%  is  recommended  for  all  SPiCT  advice  rules,  stabilizing  catch advice while allowing flexibility. If a SPiCT assessment is not accepted even after fine  tuning  (see  Figure  12),  the  2/3-PA  rule  should  be  used  for  management  advice,  where the FMSY proxy can be derived from various methods, such as length-based meth-ods  and  indicators  or  catch-only  methods.  Despite  these  general  recommendations  concerning SPiCT-based  advice  rules,  case-specific  MSEs  are  needed  and  should  be  used for the evaluation and comparison of a set of advice rules. The recommendations can be summarized with the decision tree in Figure 2.12to derive adequate advice rules for stocks suitable for a SPiCT assessment in categories 3 and 4. 
24  |ICES WKLIFE VIII REPORT 2018Figure 2.12. Decision tree for SPiCT assessment of ICES category 3 & 4 stocks, with following an-notations: 1  a  set  of  guidelines  (see  below)  assists  working  groups  with  the  decision  of  the  ac-ceptance  and  rejection  of  individual  SPiCT assessments; 2  e.g.  tighter  prior  on  n;  3  with  an  FMSYproxy from alternative assessment methods, such as length-based methods, or catch only models. Important criteria as guidance for SPiCT assessment acceptance:•Model converged (res$opt$convergence == 0); •All    parameter    uncertainties    could    be    estimated    (!any(is.infi-nite(res$sd))); •No violation of model assumptions (spictplot.diagnostics(res)); •Consistent trend in the retrospective analysis (ret <- fit.retro(res)); •Non-influential starting values (check.ini(res)); •Meaningful biological and fisheries-related parameters (𝐾𝐾, 𝑟𝑟, 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡, 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡); •Meaningful confidence intervals (not too large). where ’res’ is the object with the results of the SPiCT assessment (res <- fit.spict(inp)). If any of these points is not fulfilled, the assessment in its current state should be re-jected and a fine tuning of the SPiCT assessment should be considered. In particular, tightening the prior on n can help model convergence and performance, but other tun-ing procedures should also be considered, such as defining outliers or expected noise levels   for   input   data,   etc.   (for   more   information   see   the   SPiCT   manual   at   https://github.com/tokami/spict/blob/wklife8/spict/vignettes/vignette.pdf. 2.5Future workThe SPiCT-based advice rules should be implemented within another MSE framework.

38  |ICES WKLIFE VIII REPORT 2018Figure 3.6. Effect of data timing on the performance of the alternative catch rule 3.2.2. Shown are the median SSB trajectories for the 29 simulated stocks, ordered by k, for the roller-coaster fishing history and for the case where Fproxy was derived from FMSY. The timing of the index is relative the intermediate (assessment) year, -1 indicates data up to the year before intermediate year and 1 up to the beginning of the advice for which the advice is given. TAC period 2 refers to biennial advice, and 1 to annual advice.3.2Conclusions1 )The WKMSYCat34 catch rule 3.2.1 suffers from a range of issues, as has been previously  described  in  detail,  e.g.  time-lags  between  assessment  and  ad-vice, assumed values for reference points and/or period, and the catch rule being a product of several factors; WKLIFE VII (ICES, 2018). 2 )Under Gislason mortality and sigmaR=0.3, and with the usual lags (2 over 3 rule and the lag between assessment and advice), the 3.2.1 catch rule without further tuning resulted in collapses for stocks with k>0.32, and three further clusters  were  identified  for  the  cases  where  k≤0.32, those that end around BMSY, around 2BMSY, and around 3BMSY:2.1 )Adding a multiplier to the catch rule (0.5–0.95) without weighting the different components of the rule did not lead to improvement across all summary statistics (i.e. generally there was a catch vs. risk trade-off).2.2 )Performance  was  improved  by  introducing  asymmetric  i.e.  upper  (~1.2) and lower (~0.7) catch constraints.2.3 )Performance was improved by reducing time-lags (i.e. using more re-cent data), even for some of the k>0.32 stocks; reducing time-lags also and generally reducing fluctuations.
ICES WKLIFE VIII REPORT 2018|  39 3 )Similar conclusions apply for the 3.2.2 catch rule (the Icelandic rule) in terms of the clusters based on k, and the improvement in performance by reducing time-lags. 4 )For both rules 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, the extent to which reference levels were cor-rectly set determined how precautionary the rules were. 5 )Recruitment  variability  (sigmaR)  and  alternative  natural  mortality  (M)  as-sumptions had an important impact on outcomes since these affect the na-ture of the variability of the time-series. 5.1 )the k  above  which  the  3.2.1  catch  rule  failed  was  reduced  for  some  combinations of sigmaRand M,  and  the  extent  of  the  reduction  also  depended on operating model scenario (one-way or roller-coaster); 5.2 )the use of alternative M vectors changed the nature of the time-series (e.g. increased fluctuations for higher M), and hence the performance of the 3.2.1 catch rule. 6 )When running simulations under a perfect information scenario (setting Itrig-ger  to  0.5BMSY  and  using  the  MSY  length  as  reference  length)  the  catch  rule  moved most stocks (apart from the high k stocks) towards BMSY  and main-tained this level, i.e. the catch rule led to the desired results. A further anal-ysis   of   the   individual   catch   components   under   perfect   knowledge   conditions revealed that:6.1 )the r and b components of the rule dominated at different times, i.e. between  the  recovery  period  and  maintaining  the  stock  at  the  MSY  level.  The  f  component  had  the  lowest  impact;  this  highlighted  the  need to consider the relative weighting of these different components, and that different weighting combinations could be used to improve performance of the rule;6.2 )the clustering when k<0.32 was likely due to the way the protection element of the rule (the b-component) specified the Itrigger value; when this value was set at 0.5BMSY instead of 1.4 times the lowest observed historical index, the rules for k<0.32 reached their intended target; a reason for this is that the oscillations observed in the stock dynamics increased with k, and the very high volatility of the highest k stocks might be used to explain the poor performance of the catch rule for these stocks.3.3RecommendationThe performance of the 3.2.1 catch rule can be improved in terms of risk by applying a multiplier. Last year, based on a limited number of simulations (only four representa-tive stocks), a multiplier of 0.95 was proposed independent of k. This year, to keep the probability of dropping below Blim to 5% or less, and based on a larger number of stocks representing a wide range of life-history characteristics, simulations indicated a revi-sion of this proposal incorporating k. If a multiplier were to be used independent of k, a  multiplier  of  no  greater  than  0.8  is  recommended.  If  a  multiplier  were  to  be  used  depending on the value of k, then for k values in the range of 0.08–0.19, a multiplier of no greater than 0.85 is recommended, and for k values in the range of 0.20–0.32, a mul-tiplier of no greater than 0.90 is recommended. For k values above 0.32, the 3.2.1 catch rule should not be applied in its current form. 
40  |ICES WKLIFE VIII REPORT 20183.4Future directionsTrends  and  fluctuations  in  populations  are  determined  by  complex  interactions  be-tween extrinsic forcing and intrinsic dynamics. For example, stochastic recruitment can induce  low-frequency  variability,  i.e.  ‘cohort  resonance’,  which  can  induce  apparent  trends  in  abundance  and  may  be  common  in  age-structured  populations;  such  low-frequency fluctuations can potentially mimic or cloak critical variation in abundance linked  to  environmental  change,  over-exploitation  or  other  types  of  anthropogenic  forcing  (Bjørnstad,  2004).  Although  important,  these  effects  can  be  difficult  to  disen-tangle. The simulations so far show that life histories are important and should be used to  help  condition  operating  models  to  ensure  robust  feedback-control  rules.  MSE  is  important to help develop these robust feedback control rules and to help identify ap-propriate observational systems.Although  the  performance  of  the  HCR  depended  on  the  life-history  characteristic, it was not in the way initially expected, i.e. the outcomes could not be grouped solely by whether the Operating Models (OMs) represented fast growing vs. late maturing spe-cies or demersal vs. pelagic stocks. What was important was the nature of the dynam-ics, i.e. how variable was the stock between years; for example, a stock could exhibit high interannual variability if natural mortality and recruitment variability was high, regardless  of  the  values  of  k, Linf, L50.  The  nature  of  the  indices  is  also  important;  for  example, even if a stock had low interannual variability, an index could be highly var-iable  if  it  was  based  on  juveniles  or  there  were  large  changes  in  spatial  distribution  between years. It is therefore necessary to look at the robustness of HCRs to the nature of the time-series of the stock (as represented by the OM) and to the characteristics of the data collected from it (as represented by the Observation Error Model). This will require tuning by constructing a reference set of OMs and then tuning the HCR to se-cure the desired trade-offs. The work so far can be considered as focusing first on de-veloping HCR that perform satisfactorily for a reference set, the next step is to develop case-specific HCRs.1 )Aspects to consider for the 3.2.1 rule by the next meeting would be:1.1 )Investigating the impact of relative weighting of the r, f and b compo-nents of the rule on the performance of the rule;1.2 )Investigating more extensively the time-lag properties of the r  com-ponent, including alternative formulations; 1.3 )Setting of appropriate reference levels in the f and b component of the rules, and the extent to which this could be done with tuning that de-pends on life-history traits and/or the nature of the time-series; 1.4 )Investigation of the use of trends in an index without a reference level.2 )Longer term aspect to consider for data-limited rules:2.1 )Focusing on the nature of time-series and developing diagnostics that could help determine the rules that would work well under alterna-tive characterisations of the nature of the time-series, and aspects such as  quality  of  data  used  by  the  rules  (and  hence  ability  to  detect  sig-nals), ability to set appropriate reference points, etc.; 2.2 )Linking  life-history traits, the form of density-dependence and  fish-ery characteristics (e.g. including fishery selectivity) to the nature of resulting time-series; 2.3 )Develop guidance for use of catch rules by linking (a) and (b);
ICES WKLIFE VIII REPORT 2018|  41 2.4 )Avoiding the shot-gun approach to simulation testing e.g. by making more extensive use of sensitivity (elasticity) analysis to highlight fac-tors that are most important in determining the time-series behaviour of stocks;2.5 )Investigating the implications of how the operating models are set up (fishing history, depletion levels, selectivity assumptions, mortality) on  the  behaviour  of  the  stock  and  on  the  performance  of  the  catch  rule.
