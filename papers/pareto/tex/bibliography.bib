abstract = {One of the main advantages of the cloud computing paradigm is that it simplifies the time-consuming processes of hardware provisioning, hardware purchasing and software deployment. Currently, we are witnessing a proliferation in the number of cloud-hosted applications with a tremendous increase in the scale of the data generated as well as being consumed by such applications. Cloud-hosted database systems powering these applications form a critical component in the software stack of these applications. Service Level Agreements (SLA) represent the contract which captures the agreed upon guarantees between a service provider and its customers. The specifications of existing service level agreement (SLA) for cloud services are not designed for flexibly handling even relatively straightforward performance and technical requirements of consumer applications. The concerns of consumers for cloud services regarding the SLA management of their hosted applications within the cloud environments will gain increasing importance as cloud computing becomes more pervasive. This paper introduces the notion, challenges and the importance of SLA-based provisioning and cost management for cloud-hosted databases from the consumer perspective. We present an end-to-end framework that acts as a middleware which resides between the consumer applications and the cloud-hosted databases. The aim of the framework is to facilitate adaptive and dynamic provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own SLA performance requirements, avoiding the cost of any SLA violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing resources. The experimental results demonstrate that SLA-based provisioning is more adequate for providing consumer applications the required flexibility in achieving their goals.},

This paper presents a novel multi-objective optimization model that can assist designers in green building design. The Pareto solution was used to obtain a set of optimal solutions for building design optimization, and uses an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) as a theoretical basis for building design multi-objective optimization model. Based on the simulation data on energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort, the study also used a simulation-based improved back-propagation (BP) network which is optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) to characterize building behavior, and then establishes a GA-BP network model for rapidly predicting the energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort status of residential buildings; Third, the building design multi-objective optimization model was established by using the GA-BP network as a fitness function of the multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II); Finally, a case study is presented with the aid of the multi-objective approach in which dozens of potential designs are revealed for a typical building design in China, with a wide range of trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy consumption.},

A mathematical model based on the finite-time thermodynamics has been developed so that the output power and thermal efficiency and the rate of entropy generation of the solar Stirling system with finite rate of heat transfer, regenerative heat loss, conductive thermal bridging loss and finite regeneration process time are obtained. Furthermore, imperfect performance of the dish collector and convective/radiative heat transfer mechanisms at the hot end as well as the convective heat transfer at the heat sink of the engine are considered in the developed model. Three objective functions including the output power and overall thermal efficiency have been considered simultaneously for maximization and the rate of entropy generation of the Stirling engine are minimized at the same time. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) based on NSGA-II algorithm has been employed while the Effectiveness's of regenerator, the Effectiveness's of the low temperature heat exchanger, the Effectiveness's of the high temperature heat exchanger, heat capacitance rate of the heat sink, heat capacitance rate of the heat source, temperatures of the working fluid in the high temperature isothermal process and temperatures of the working fluid in the low temperature isothermal process are considered as decision variables.

@article{Deb2001,
abstract = {As the name suggests, multi-objective optimization involves optimizing a number of objectives simultaneously. The problem becomes challenging when the objectives are of conflict to each other, that is, the optimal solution of an objective function is different from that of the other. In solving such problems, with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Due to the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved suitably using evolutionary algorithms which use a population approach in its search procedure. Starting with parameterized procedures in early nineties, the so-called evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms is now an established field of research and application with many dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and workshops held at all major evolutionary computing conferences, and full-time researchers from universities and industries from all around the globe. In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction to its operating principles and outline the current research and application studies of EMO.},

A brief discussion of the work of Borel and von Neumann as initiators of game theory is included. Each of these areas has developed enough to warrant its own survey; hence, they are reviewed here only insofar as they provide necessary foun- dations. Thereafter, the concepts of efficiency, vector maximum prob- lem, and Pareto optimality are reviewed in connection with production theory, programming, and economics. The survey is presented within a unified mathematical framework, and the emphasis is on mathematical results, rather than psychological or socio-economic discussion.

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

@article{Bao2017,
abstract = {Evolutionary computation has shown great performance in solving many multi-objective optimization problems; in many such algorithms, non-dominated sorting plays an important role in determining the relative quality of solutions in a population. However, the implementation of non-dominated sorting can be computationally expensive, especially for populations with a large number of solutions and many objectives. The main reason is that most existing non-dominated sorting algorithms need to compare one solution with almost all others to determine its front, and many of these comparisons are redundant or unnecessary. Another reason is that as the number of objectives increases, more and more candidate solutions become non-dominated solutions, and most existing time-saving approaches cannot work effectively. In this paper, we present a novel non-dominated sorting strategy, called Hierarchical Non-Dominated Sorting (HNDS). HNDS first sorts all candidate solutions in ascending order by their first objective. Then it compares the first solution with all others one by one to make a rapid distinction between different quality solutions, thereby avoiding many unnecessary comparisons. Experiments on populations with different numbers of solutions, different numbers of objectives and different problems have been done. The results show that HNDS has better computational efficiency than fast non-dominated sort, Arena's principle and deductive sort.},

abstract = {The function of operators in an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is very crucial as the operators have a strong effect on the performance of the EA. In this paper, a new selection operator is introduced for a real valued encoding problem, which specifically exists in a shrimp diet formulation problem. This newly developed selection operator is a hybrid between two well-known established selection operators: roulette wheel and binary tournament selection. A comparison of the performance of the proposed operator and the other existing operator was made for evaluation purposes. The result shows that the proposed roulette-tournament selection is better in terms of its ability to provide many good feasible solutions when a population size of 30 is used. Thus, the proposed roulette-tournament is suitable and comparable to established selection for solving a real valued shrimp diet formulation problem. The selection operator can also be generalized to any problems related to EA.},
